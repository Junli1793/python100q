Reading and Writing JSON to a File in Python
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-and-writing-json-to-a-file-in-python/

The full form of JSON is Javascript Object Notation.
It means that a script (executable) file which is made of text in a programming language, is used to store and transfer the data.
Python supports JSON through a built-in package called JSON.
To use this feature, we import the JSON package in Python script.
The text in JSON is done through quoted-string which contains the value in key-value mapping within { }.
It is similar to the dictionary in Python.
